# Machine-Learning

Hello Everyone,

I am not an expert in Machine Learning. I am just a NEWBIE. Just trying to do some practice on some of rare data set.
All the files which are uploaded contains data  like missing value treatment, outliers treatment, Visualization part. 
I have attached an HTML file in which you can see the output of .py files(or codes)

1. Classification= You will see a file named this in that i have tried to do build model using some classification methods. 

2. Logistic_Regression: As the name clears itself that it contains Logistic Regression

3. HR_Works: In this file a company wants to figure out what is the problem behind joining of candidates as they comes up with some costs and time consumption while conducting Interview
but some candidates didn't join after clearing all round. They want to figure out from previous records as the candidate having similar qualities will likely to join company or not
after selection
